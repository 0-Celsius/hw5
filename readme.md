# HW 5 - Scrabble
This project was made by kelvin L., the goal was to imitate the game scrabbled but on 1 row. This website reflects this as you're playing one game of scrabble.


# Things that were implemented:
- Jquery
- a rack for the player's 7 initial tiles
- a row for the game
    - a checker that prevents:
        - spacing rows
        - overlaying on already used rows; no error msg
        - atleast 1 on the board to submit
- implemented a triple word/letter checkers squares
    - did not have enough time to get to it, but kept it in case for later updates
- a submit button
    - to submit the current jibberish to get points
- a score for current game and overall game score
- a reset button 
    - allows player to reset the overall game score and a new rack
- had a friend test it :> (thank mr. unnamed)
    - didnt find any errors
        - really help find certain errors like spacing error, that i forgot to account for lmao

# Things that were not implemented that would be nice to have:
- the whole board
- a dictonary checker
    - could be done with an imported dictonary 
        - then cross reference on the board
        - would need to add an array checker to board
        
# extra credit:
- a total and current board score;
    - wasnt too clear if this counted
- the other special cases on the board
    - just werent show on current board, but were implement if desired to added in 

# Overall
Pretty fun project, I hope whoever plays it enjoys it as much as I did. I wished I had a bit more time to add in more features, but I was also busy with work and the holiday.

 Anyhow cheers and thanks for playing! - K
